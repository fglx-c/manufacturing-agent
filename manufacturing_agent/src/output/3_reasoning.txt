For optimal control of layer 3, I recommend implementing ["300W power reheat pass", "90s dwell"]. This decision is based on the automated analysis from simulations where option 1 offers the lowest full volume L2 error of 310, indicating better conformance to the target temperature field compared to other options. The higher power reheat combined with a significant dwell time will help in minimizing thermal gradients and thereby reduce internal stresses, leading to a higher quality part. Although historical comparison data for layer 2 wasn't available, selecting the option with the lowest error is a robust choice, ensuring consistency and minimizing deviation from the desired parameters.
