The reasoning for layer 2's control actions is based on minimizing deviation from the target temperature field to ensure the highest quality. Addressing uneven cooling spots is critical to prevent stress accumulation. The decision includes a 45-second dwell time to stabilize temperature discrepancies and a reheat to 250 units, ensuring even temperature distribution across the layer. This procedure aims to mitigate residual stresses or imperfections, ensuring the layer aligns with the intended thermal profile.
