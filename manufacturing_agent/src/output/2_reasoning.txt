Based on the available options, the lowest expected error for layer 2 is achieved with Option 3, which includes a 60s dwell followed by a 200W power reheat pass. This choice minimizes the deviation from the target temperature field with an expected full volume L2 error of 297, which is the lowest among the options. Considering the data, Option 1 also presents a relatively low error, but Option 3 is slightly better. Without access to prior layer results, it is prudent to choose the action that results in the smallest immediate error for layer 2, which is Option 3. Therefore, the control actions I recommend for layer 2 are: ["dwell 60", "reheat 200"].
