Given the constraints and the need to minimize deviation from the target temperature field, I propose the following set of post-layer steps: ["dwell 80", "reheat 250"]. The choice of "dwell 80" allows for adequate cooling time to verify thermal stability across the entire layer, ensuring consistent crystallization and bonding, which is critical for structural integrity. Following this, a "reheat 250" step enables partial reheating to address any local hot spots or irregularities in temperature distribution that may have occurred during the layering process. This combination has been selected based on balancing sufficient cooling with controlled reheating, aiming to optimize the thermal profile for layer 4 and maintain the highest quality part production.
