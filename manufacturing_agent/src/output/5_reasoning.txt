The decision to apply a 60-second dwell followed by a reheat of 250 units is to minimize deviation from the target temperature field. This approach adheres to the constraint of avoiding dwells over 60 seconds to prevent overheating or cooling periods that might induce stresses or defects. The reheat of 250 units compensates for potential heat loss, keeping the material within optimal temperature ranges for solidification and bonding. This strikes a balance between immediate manufacturing constraints and maintaining high part quality through minimized thermal deviations.
